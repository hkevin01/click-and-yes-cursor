# Test Plan

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
- [x] Verify directory structure: src, tests, docs, scripts
- [x] Check existence and correctness of configuration files (.gitignore, .editorconfig, .prettierrc)
- [x] Validate dependency management files (package.json, requirements.txt)
- [x] Confirm boilerplate code is present and runs without errors
- [x] Ensure initial documentation files exist

## Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [x] Test click automation in Node.js and Python (robotjs, pyautogui)
- [x] Test typing automation for "yes, continue"
- [x] Validate configuration for coordinates (config.json, CLI args)
- [x] Test error handling for invalid input and automation failures
- [x] Run on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) or simulate where possible

## Phase 3: Testing & QA
- [x] Run unit tests (jest for Node.js, pytest for Python)
- [x] Run integration tests simulating full workflow
- [x] Validate CI setup and test execution (GitHub Actions)
- [x] Check code for linting and formatting issues
- [x] Document test coverage and results in docs

## Phase 4: Documentation & Community
- [x] Verify documentation completeness (usage, troubleshooting)
- [x] Confirm contribution guidelines and issue templates are clear
- [x] Test community engagement features (issues, discussions)
- [x] Ensure changelog is updated
- [x] Validate accessibility of documentation

## Phase 5: Advanced Features & Release
- [x] Test image recognition automation (OpenCV script)
- [x] Test GUI configuration tool (Tkinter script)
- [x] Review release preparation steps (final code review, tagging)
- [x] Validate packaging and release notes
- [x] Confirm maintenance and feedback processes are documented
