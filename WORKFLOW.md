# Development Workflow

## Branching Strategy
- Use `main` for production-ready code.
- Feature branches: `feature/<name>`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/<name>`
- Pull requests required for merging.

## CI/CD Pipelines
- Automated tests and builds via GitHub Actions.
- Deployment triggered on merge to `main`.

## Code Review
- All code changes require review via pull requests.
- Use comments and suggestions for improvements.

## Issue Tracking
- Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests.

## Release Process
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for each release.
- Tag releases in GitHub.

## Logging Workflow
- All changes to the project, including code changes, configuration updates, and test outputs, should be logged in the `logs` folder.
- Each log entry should include a timestamp, a brief description of the change or test, and any relevant output or results.
- This practice ensures traceability, easier debugging, and a clear audit trail for project evolution.
